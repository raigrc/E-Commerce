                <h3>NO RETURN, NO EXCHANGE POLICY</h3><br>
                <p> The DTI reiterates that the “No Return, No Exchange” policy is prohibited because this is considered a deceptive sales act. Under Republic Act No. 7394 (RA 7394) or the “Consumer Act of the Philippines,” as well as its Implementing Rules and Regulations, the words “No Return, No Exchange” or words to such effect shall not be written into the contract of sale, receipt in a sales transaction, in any document evidencing such sale or anywhere in a store or business establishment.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Consumer Act of the Philippines specifies, “Sellers are obliged to honor their warranties and grant corresponding remedies to consumers”. As such, consumers should be allowed to return or exchange the goods, or avail themselves of other remedies, in case of hidden faults or defects, or any charge the buyer was not aware of the time of purchase. In enforcing these remedies, however, consumers should bear in mind to at least prove the sale transaction and show an evidence such as the official receipt. In cases where the official receipt is not available, the buyer may resort to any other alternative proof.
